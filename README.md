## Login and Signup system
A Authentication website using following technologies: MongoDB-- for Database handling bcrypt--bcrypt is a password-hashing. In this system I added some i.e. salting+hashing process to increse level of security. This is Level-4 authentication. This system is designed in a way to prevent hackers to hack into our Database and if they hack they won't be able to crack users credential.

## Working
1.Its very simple first you have to Register in our database 2.with those credential you can easily Login.

## To open to your local system
## Install node_modules using express and run localhost:3000/
